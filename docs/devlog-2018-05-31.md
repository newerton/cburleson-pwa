Turns out, TinyMCE isn't free anymore, so we'll have to find another WYSIWYG editor like Quill.

See:

https://github.com/quilljs/quill

and

https://github.com/KillerCodeMonkey/ngx-quill-example

and

https://quilljs.com/


But actually, there is no Table editor!!!


Still, there is no other free alternative and it looks like some people may be working on it.

So...

**Commit** Add Quill editor to authoring page.
