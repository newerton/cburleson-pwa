Today we're going to try to build an editor using TinyMCE and see if we 
can't have the basis for something that can make it easier to manage content.

Install the Angular TinyMCE component:

`npm install @tinymce/tinymce-angular`

Next, we need a page view that's going to hold the component, so go through 
the process of creating a new page as described in how to. We'll call this
AuthoringComponent or authoring (EditorComponent is already what the TinyMCE is called)

`ng g c /pages/authoring`

Then the whole routine of setting up the new page component as described in how-to/how-to-create-a-new-main-page.md.

**Commit** Install TinyMCE component and stub out Authoring page
