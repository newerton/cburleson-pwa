# How to deplo to Firebase

- `npm run build` to run a prod build

- `firebase login` (and login at browser)

`firebase deploy`

It then deployed my stuff for access at:

https://cburleson02.firebaseapp.com

- Hit that in your iPhone.
- Click the little share icon and choose Add to Home Screen. Name it 'PWA'
- Go to Settings and go into airplane mode.
- Try hitting the app from your home screen. All should be good; the app should load even in airplane mode.
