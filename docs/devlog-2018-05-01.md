# 2018-05-01

This entry refers to work with the ionic PWA toolkit and Stencil work that predates a new setup 
which I started on 2018-05-11; see [devlog-2018-05-11](devlog-2018-05-11.md) and after for the log that 
specifically applies to the current project.

## Initial setup

- Initialized project with the [Ionic PWA Toolkit](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-pwa-toolkit#getting-started)
- Deleted the `.git` and `.github` directories.
- Executed `git init` to reinitialize new git repo.
- *Commit:* Initial commit (fresh start from Ionic PWA toolkit)
- Attempted to update `"@ionic/core": "4.0.0-alpha.3"` in package.json to `"@ionic/core": "4.0.0-alpha.4", but this 
resulted in an error on npm start related to no exported ToastController.
  - I search "ToastController" in the Slack channel for Stencil and found a note that said `Looks like it was renamed 
  to HTMLIonToastControllerElement'. I renamed the reference where I could find it in files and that seemed to fix the
  issue.
- Ran `npm run dev --es5` and tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- *Commit:* Rename ToastController to HTMLIonToastControllerElement to fix build.
- I then added the ion-split-pane, menu, and menu icon stuff.
- *Commit*: Add ion-split-pane, menu, and menu icon

A note from corymc related to some weirdness I was getting (that somehow went away):

`npm i @types/node@9.6.6`

For example, if i ran `npm i @stencil/core@8.0.0` it would update them (I could see it in my package-lock file)… 
but if I updated the stencil core in my package.json and then just ran `npm i` it worked fine.

If you run into issues again, that might be the fix /shrug

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Integrate the Lifetime Calendar

This is done because the intent is to use this project to replace the cburleson-platform, which deploys this app in 
a Docker container to my Azure cloud VM.

- Copied `lifetime` directory from old `cburleson-platform` to `src/`.
- Added the following dependencies to the dependencies section of `package.json`...

```
"bootstrap": "^4.1.1",
"d3": "^3.5.17",
"d3-tip": "^0.6.8",
"express": "^4.16.2",
"jquery": "^3.3.1",
"moment": "^2.13.0",
"popper.js": "^1.14.3"
```

- Deleted `node_modules/` and ran `npm i`
- Added the following to the `exports.config` stanza of the `stencil.config.js` file. This copies the dependencies to
the www directory where the lifetime app can find them.
- Executed `npm run build` and verified that the files were copied over correctly.
- Excuted `npm start` and confirmed that I could access the Lifetime Calendar at http://localhost:3333/lifetime/
- *Commit*: Add Lifetime Calendar

## Install Stencil Create Component

See: https://github.com/jagreehal/st-cc

cli to create Stencil components in your current working directory.

"This is until I (or somebody else) submits a PR to for Stencil to provide this natively."

- Executed command: `npm install -g st-cc`
- `st-cc`
  - What is the name of the component you want to create? `app-glass`
  - Is shadow component? (y/N) `N`
  - What type of style file? (Use arrow keys) `scss`
  - Create test file (Y/n) `Y`
  - `Stencil component app-glass created!`
  
## Create a new main page and sub page

I created a new main page and a new sub page and documented [how to do it](../how-to/create-a-new-page.md).

The pages I created were for demonstrating my experimental Glass Web Components.
I also added my todo component from the old cburleson-platform project.

*Commit*: Add app-glass, app-glass-todo, and todo component.
