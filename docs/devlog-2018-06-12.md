Going to use CKEditor instead of Quill.

First, I remove the Quill stuff from last work.

**Commit** Remove Quill

See: https://github.com/chymz/ng2-ckeditor

Include CKEditor javascript files in your application :

<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/4.5.11/full/ckeditor.js"></script>

For now, I put this on index.html in the head section.
