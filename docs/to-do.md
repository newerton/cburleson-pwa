# TO DO

- [ ] Menu does not open in Safari on iOS served from Firebase
  - [ ] Test console logging with connection to mac
  - [ ] Test in Chrome on iPhone
- [ ] Right now, it seems service worker may only cache what you've browsed? Not sure. See if there is a way 
to pre-cache important stuff in service worker config or whatever. In any case - test this, learn about it,
document it.
